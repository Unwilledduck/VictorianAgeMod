 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Victorian Age"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The year is 1850. In Europe the flames of revolution raged over. With angry population and rising empires who will succeed? The German states are in unrest and want to be unified more than ever. Will it be Prussia or Austria that will take the leading role in this conflict? The United States is building up its nation adding more states on the west coast but on the east coast unhappiness is rising. Which empires will rise and write history? This is the Victorian Era."
 UNK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mighty United Kingdom. Long live our Queen Victoria! We might have won the war against Napoleon but another war will be coming. So many nations want their spot on this world. Are you the one that keeps our country safe?"
 PRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "All hail the king of Prussia! Frederick William IV is our strong leader. After the German Confederation the German states are left in a state of unknown. There is a conflict of ideals within the region. In 1848 Denmark humiliated the German states. After the sparks of revolution raged over in 1848 Prussia adopted the first constitution. The coming years will be vital for the Prussian future. Will Prussia unite the German people under 1 leader or shall it be destroyed? War is coming. And in times of war we must protect ourselves!"
 OTT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Abdulmejid I, you are the leader of the Ottoman Empire. For years we have ruled the middle east and spread our influence across the Mediterranean Sea. We sure aren’t the nation we once where but we are still powerful and we shall show them. The Balkans are unstable and we need to control the region well. But the Russians want to protect ‘their’ people in the region and question our rule. Maybe it is time to show the world what the might Ottoman Empire is up to! "
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Viva la France! After the revolution in 1848 we are unstable. This nation is divided and needs a strong leader. Will we find one in Napoleon III? Or do we need to give the power to the people? France is a colonial power but it still stands in the shadow of the mighty British Empire. Is this the time France will restore its former glory like under Napoleon Bonaparte?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The glorious United States of America. The home of the free. But in this nation there are lots of problems. The local tribes don’t agree with the modernization of their lands. The south and north are more divided than ever. This nation needs a strong leader to keep the people together. Otherwise we could see yet another disastrous war in our land after the War of 1812 with Great Britain. Don’t let our brothers be brothers in arms."
 RUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "All hail the Tsar! Our glorious leader that will lead our nation towards modernization. Russia always was a rural nation with lots of farmers. Can we industrialize our nation and try to match the other European nations? The Ottomans are weak and an easy target. We signed a deal with Prussia and the Austrian Empire that we shall aid each other in times of need. It looks like we are back in the game!"
 AHU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Franz Jopseh the First! You are our leader. The nation is divided into way too many small nationalities. It will be a very difficult task but it is absolute necessary. If we don’t unify the people civil war will defiantly break out. The Prussians are also willing to unify the German people under one nation. But we still have the most support from other German states. Will the Prussians be foolish enough to go to war after we fought side by side against Napoleon? "
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan is a traditional nation. The Shogun and the Emperor need to work together for a healthy balance of peace and order. But with western nations knocking on our doors for trade we came to realise we cannot isolate ourselves forever. Japan is the ship. And we must choose our captain. The Emperor or the Shogun?"
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of yet another global conflict after Napoleons Campaigns from the 1810’s. From major powers on the brink of civil war, after the revolutions of 1848, to the many nations formed and transformed, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
